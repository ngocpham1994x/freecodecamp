# :book: freecodecamp
These are my solutions/my projects to freecodecamp.org . 

The IDE of these projects are codepen.io and my own text editor (link to [my codepen.io dashboard](https://www.codepen.io/ngocpham1994x) here).

Some tips I collected during learning process:

- if using Chrome, some extensions might interfere with the test link provided by freecodecamp.org. In my case, it was Privacy Badger. Disable the extension fixed the issue.
